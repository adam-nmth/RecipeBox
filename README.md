# RecipeBox
Simple recipe box using React.js and LocalStorage.

The app checks if there are any recipes in the users local storage at first. If there is none, it creates 3 examples.
To use, include the .css and .js file in the head of the html. Also needs React, React DOM and Babel to be installed, and css is using SCSS preprocessor.
